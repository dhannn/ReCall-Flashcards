[CCICOMP] Hardware Components

Explain the machine cycle. 
- CPU fetches instructions from RAM. Control unit decodes the instructions. 
ALU executes instructions. Results are stored back to RAM.

Diffferentiate random-access memory and hard drive.
- RAM is volatile memory that is cleared when shutdown while the hard drive 
stores long-term non-volatile memory. RAM is faster while the hard drive is slower.
